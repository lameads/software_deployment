# wifi_sniffer_deploy_v19
Latest version of the wifi sniffer. Takes command line arguments specifying NIC as well as the channels with which to sniff on that NIC. Takes up to 8 NICs. This repository contains the pre-compiled code for deploying on ubuntu 24.04 for both 23 and 24 series machines. The code is compiled to use the directory name "wifi_sniffer" as the sniffer's project directory, so the folder should be renamed when cloning this repository and moved to the home directory of the guard user (guard user must be created and given root privileges if it does not exist already on the host machine).
